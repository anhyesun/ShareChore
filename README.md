## Inspiration
Conflicts with roommates over shared chores.

## What it does
ShareChore is a “Housework Management Application” that allows users to organize chores.

## How we built it
We developed this app using XML and Java. We spent a fair amount of time on UI/UX design with various tools including Figma. Considering the time constraint and the scope of our project, we settled for storing data locally instead of using cloud services.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us had any experience with Android development before this weekend so familiarizing ourselves with Android Studios and doing researches for available API/libraries.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
By the end of this crazy 24 hours, we have a functional Android App on our phones

## What we learned
Teamwork; Android Studio; XML

## What's next for cmd-f
More Hackathons and amazing collaborations

## Built With
* Java
* XML
* Android Studio
* JSON
